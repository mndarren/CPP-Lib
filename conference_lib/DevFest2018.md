2. Don't wait for Pentesting: Code Securely Now (from Paula Merns)
   ```
   5 Tips
   		1) validate your input (type and length and required patterns)
   		2) sanitize your input (never pass input data directly into an event handler)
   		3) Parameterize your queries (avoid SQL injection)
   		4) Don't store stuff where you shouldn't
   			Look at the standards for your environment
			Don’t put sensitive data into cookies, local data stores, etc.
			Don’t write unnecessary information to disk/memory
			Don’t place unencrypted sensitive data in the Query String
   		5) Encrypt at rest and while transmitting
   			choose algorithm with checking the link: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet
   			The current first choice should be Argon2
   			Use configuration file and never put password in github code
   ```

   The more data training, the better.<br>
	Training and prediction
4. Practical Test-Driven Development in Angular & Why Dating Advice is the worst (from Alvin Faisal)<br>
	He used a new approach to show his presentation with a lot of non-tech pictures (New way but don't like it)<br>
