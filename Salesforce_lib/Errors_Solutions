# Errors Fixed Solution 4 SF
===========================================
1. Error: Apex CPU Time limit exceeded
```
   # Reason
     . 10 seconds for sync limit, 60 for Async limit;
	 . Counts: Yes - Apex code, Lib function, Workflow
	           No  - SOQL, SML, HTTP callouts
   # Solutions
   1) Using map based on query
      Map<Id, Account> aMap = new Map<Id, Account>([SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 50000]);
	  Don't get query result and then use a loop to get the Id set or other list.
   2) Operation Async: @future
   3) Aggregate SOQL usage: SUM,AVG... Don't use a loop to do sum.
   4) On VF page, if too much data on the page to update, then
      Add rendered="{!classInstance.collateral.size <= maxCollateralViewSize}" on the pageBlockSection
```
2. Error: Aggregate query has too many rows for direct assignment, use FOR loop
```
   # Reason
     When accessing a large set of child records (200 or more) of a retrieved sObject inside the loop, or when getting the size of such a record set.
   # Solution
	 . Using Parent/Children Pattern to solve it(Put all queries in Children or Parent Class).
   # Note:
     . Always use SOQL For Loop (not Standard SOQL Queries) to process query results, to avoid the limit on heap size
	   e.g. for(varible/varible_list : [soql_query]) {}
	   But a run-time exception occurs if you use a query containing an aggregate function that returns >2000 rows.
