# Ideas
=========<br>
Some ideas poped up occasionally. In order not to losing them, record good ones here for the future.

1. Create a playbook that can be run to revert VM to the orig state.
2. Image search! (solved by cloud vision by Google 2017 or early)
3. Web UI using smart phone UI style.
4. Create a process jail for bad process. Once our IDS catches a bad process, throw it into the process jail immediately.
   Not just kill them, because killing them will tell attacker that we found them. Use time to catch out the attacker.
5. For job web site, after applying job done, web page goes to the current openning page. Applicant might apply another one.
6. Create a source repo manager object. playbook just tells the repo manager the source name and version,
   and he will return the correct one. playbook does not provide specific path for that anymore.
7. Create your own cloud using public storage space (Google drive, dropbox, box, icloud, one drive)
   Need to figure out a algorithm to connect them togather.
8. Create a new character that does not belong to a-z or A-Z or 0-9 or other specials so that hacker will never break a password with this character via brute force approach.
9. Solve problem of Guo Wengui mobile attack to control his ship and car via his cell phone.
10. Develop a program to implement security policies.
11. Build a cell phone with completely saperated physical 2 parts: the old phone call and text message, and smart phone with app WiFi. Since Skygofree and Pegasus present.
12. About AI, probablly in the future AI technology will get so high that Robot can control everything. We need to create a virus to destroy all of them.
13. put security step in Lifecycle Model (process)
14. Microservice Architectural --to describe a particular way of designing software app as suites of **independently deployable services**. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certion common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.<br>

15. Create a little file to contain all little tools (methods) which are commonly used. (doing it)
16. Create a pointing app for Scrum team by using the current web site (pointingpoker.com)
